                        International conference on recent research in management (ICRRM-2018) is organised with general objective of facilitating
                        an open and constructive dialogue between researchers and practitioners based on research works and
                        practical experiences which foster a better understanding of the worldâ€™s best management policies
                        practices. ICRRM will drastically help to provide effective managerial responses to leadership challenges
                        of the 21st century. Such forums provide a forum for exchange of information between scholars and
                        practitioners on the relationships of intelligence to management and leadership and encourage scholars
                        to share their theory, research, and experience on management and administration.
