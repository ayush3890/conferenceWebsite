                    In the current digital era a lot of research is going on in the various interrelated fields. To publish the research work
                    many conferences are held on regular basis. However these conferences have some advantages and some disadvantages
                    also. The conferences give researchers a platform to interact and publish there work. Additionally, conferences
                    also have lot of overhead expenses. The researchers have to travel to the various part of the world just
                    to publish there work and also lot of paper work is done. These overhead cost can be reduced with the
                    concept of ONLINE CONFERENCE.
                    <br>

                    Here researchers/ authors/ academicians/ Industry experts can publish and
                    present there work remotely with the help of online digital means like Skype. This concept will increase
                    the participation of authors from all over the world making the conference as truly international. This
                    concept is also nature friendly as it is paper free.
