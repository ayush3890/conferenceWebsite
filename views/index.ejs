                    International Conference on Recent Research in Technology and Management (ICRRTM-2018) is organised with the objective
                    of bringing together innovative scientists, professors, research scholars, students and industrial experts
                    in the field of Computing and Management to a common forum. The primary goal of the conference is
                    to promote the exchange of innovative scientific information between researchers, developers, engineers,
                    students, and practitioners. Another goal is to promote the transformation of fundamental research into
                    institutional and industrialised research and to convert applied exploration into real time application.
                    Overall the conference will provide the researchers and attendees with prospects for national and international
                    collaboration and networking among universities and institutions from India and abroad for promoting
                    research. ICRRTM-2018 will be held online on 3rd November 2018. All the accepted papers (after double blinded peer review)
                    are published by IEEE and extended selected papers will be published in the special issues of
                    <br>
                     SCI/SCOPUS/WoS/DBLP/ACM indexed Journals.
