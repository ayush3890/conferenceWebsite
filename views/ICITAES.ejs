                        International conference on innovative technological advancements in engineering and sciences (ICITAES-2018) is organised
                        with the objective of bringing together innovative scientists, professors, research scholars, students
                        and industrial experts in the field of Computing and Communication to a common forum. The primary
                        goal of the conference is to promote the exchange of innovative scientific information between researchers,
                        developers, engineers, students, and practitioners. Another goal is to promote the transformation
                        of fundamental research into institutional and industrialised research and to convert applied exploration
                        into real time application.
